I am unable to compress the dataset and upload it here in this repo, so I'll be adding the link for the dataset here. Maybe it will be more useful and efficient for you to work along with the realt data

https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

The above link will redirect you to the NYC Yellow taxi data and along with it you can find the dataset for Green taxi and For-Hire-vehicles datset as well.
